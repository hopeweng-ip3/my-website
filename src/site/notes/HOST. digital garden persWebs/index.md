        <h1 style="margin-top: 0;">The Art of Preemptive Care</h1>
        <p>We often believe that to find our path, we must look forward, strategizing our next move with precision. But sometimes, the most profound direction comes from looking at what we are already trying to heal.</p>
        <p>C. [cite_start]Allen Weng began his journey studying preventive medicine, drawn to its principle of preemptive care[cite: 2, 22]. [cite_start]He came to understand that his deepest aptitude lay in formal reasoning and reflective thinking—capacities that technical education often bypasses[cite: 3]. [cite_start]He realized that true health is the presence of agency and the ability to make deliberate choices[cite: 4, 26].</p>
        [cite_start]<p>This website is a garden, a sanctuary for discovery that resists the pressure to be finished[cite: 5]. [cite_start]Here, he explores the sociotechnical alignment between human needs and digital tools[cite: 26]. [cite_start]He asks how we can preserve dignity in an age of automated influence and design systems that respect the unquantifiable growth of the human spirit[cite: 18].</p>
        [cite_start]<p>This is a space for <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/3MZtjQbdCWXT13ZQCNZ5jg">overlooked voices</a> and non-traditional paths[cite: 19]. [cite_start]It is a documentation of his work in complex systems, offered not as a final answer, but as an invitation to pose daring questions without guarantees[cite: 9, 55].</p>
        [cite_start]<p>Welcome to the process of becoming intelligent, not by knowing more, but by thinking with greater clarity and humility[cite: 11, 13].</p>
