>> # The Art of Preemptive Care
>>
>> We often believe that to find our path, we must look forward, strategizing our next move with precision. But sometimes, the most profound direction comes from looking at what we are already trying to heal.
>>
>> This website is a **digital garden**—an ad-hoc structure that resists the pressure to be finished. It does not follow the linear logic of a feed; instead, it grows organically, mirroring the non-linear way we actually think.
>>
>> C. Allen Weng ("Allen") uses this space to practice the "art of preemptive care" on an informational level. He realized that the fractures we face today are not just biological, but algorithmic. The crisis is not just in our bodies, but in how we perceive, choose, and exist within the systems we have built.
>>
>> Here, he explores **sociotechnical alignment**: the critical intersection where human needs meet digital tools. He studies social algorithms not to optimize them for engagement, but to ask how we can preserve dignity in an age of automated influence. He seeks to design systems that respect the unquantifiable growth of the human spirit rather than flattening it.

>> This garden is a documentation of that work in complex systems. It is a space for [overlooked voices](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/3MZtjQbdCWXT13ZQCNZ5jg) and non-traditional paths—offered not as a final answer, but as an invitation to pose daring questions without guarantees.

>> Welcome to the process of becoming intelligent, not by knowing more, but by thinking with greater clarity and humility.
