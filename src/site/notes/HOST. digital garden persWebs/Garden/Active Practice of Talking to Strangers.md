"Excuse me, hi! I saw you and I thought you were cute, I just had to come say hi," Benjamin says as he initiates a direct and respectful approach on the street. 

This recording reflects his core strategy of using natural, genuine conversation rather than "cringey" or "sleazy" pickup lines that many women find uncomfortable. By focusing on a "wholesome" interaction—starting with a simple "hello" and a compliment on the person's outfit or style—he demonstrates the bravery and confidence that the interviewed women identified as highly attractive traits. His readiness to engage in this real-time practice was built on the understanding that over 75% of women actually wish they were approached more in person, provided the man is nice, respectful, and mindful of whether they appear busy or in a rush.
