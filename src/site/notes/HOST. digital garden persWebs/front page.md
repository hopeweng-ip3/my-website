We often believe that to find our path, we must look forward—strategizing our next move with precision. But sometimes the most clarifying direction comes from examining what we're already trying to heal.

A digital garden is organized by [connection](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history#1-topography-over-timelines). Rather than a chronology for finished articles, it hosts *a network of evolving notes*—ideas that get [tended](https://publish.obsidian.md/myquantumwell/Knowledge+Management#Inheritance), [expanded](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/#the-fixed-address-of-each-note), and [linked](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/backlinks) to one another—as understanding changes. Following natural advancement, one can navigates threads related to topics; the graph view of "backlinks" reveals hidden angles. All pages reject finality and remain in conversation with old emergence and new proficiency, like the makers do.

Allen Weng studies [[HOST. digital garden persWebs/Project/Two-page Precis\|computational cognitive science]], focusing on the impacts of technology and [[HOST. digital garden persWebs/Project/Communication Attributes paper_2025\|digital media]]. His work researches how algorithmic, feed-based interaction shape perception and choice, guiding contestable HCI systems and development. He is interested in technology policy that preserve user autonomy and support social character. He loves [[HOST. digital garden persWebs/Garden/Linear Algebra\|mathematics]], and enjoys raising awareness for active social interactions.

This garden documents how he picks up signals and seeks out systems—a home for easy organizing, [[HOST. digital garden persWebs/Garden/Philosophy Works\|inner work]], [[HOST. digital garden persWebs/Garden/news and special reports\|intentional storytelling]], and [[HOST. digital garden persWebs/Garden/Personal History Statement, PhD\|centering overlooked voices]].

Feel the slower work of greater clarity: less accumulation, more humility. Listen deeply.
