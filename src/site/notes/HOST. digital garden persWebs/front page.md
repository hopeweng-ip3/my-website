We often believe we must look forward to find our path, but sometimes the most clarifying direction comes from examining what we’re already trying to heal.

A digital garden organizes itself by [connection](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history#1-topography-over-timelines), hosting *a network of evolving notes*—ideas that get [tended](https://publish.obsidian.md/myquantumwell/Knowledge+Management#Inheritance), [expanded](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/#the-fixed-address-of-each-note), and [interconnected](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/backlinks)—as knowledge deepens. By following natural advancement, one can navigate threads related to specific topics, and the graph view of "backlinks" reveals hidden connection. All pages reject finality and remain in exchange with old emergence and new representations, much like the creators of these systems.

Allen Weng studies [[HOST. digital garden persWebs/Project/Two-page Precis\|computational cognitive science]], focusing on the impacts of technology and [[HOST. digital garden persWebs/Project/Communication Attributes paper_2025\|digital media]]. His work researches how algorithmic, feed-based interaction shape perception and choice, guiding the development of contestable Human-Computer Interaction systems. He loves [[HOST. digital garden persWebs/Garden/Linear Algebra\|mathematics]] and raising awareness about active social interactions.

Welcome to the slower work of greater clarity: less accumulation, more humility. Listen deeply.
